"Zero George is a very stylish place that fits very well within its surroundings. Very much the opposite of the faceless chain hotel. Impeccably tasteful interior design within a compound of several small old buildings, with plenty of common space on porches and within the buildings, all full of atmosphere.",3,Zero 
"ZeitgemГ¤Гџe Hotels in den Bergen sind leider selten. Die meisten sind entweder altbacken oder Гјbertreiben in die eine oder andere Richtung. Das Kranzbach ist anders, denn es wirkt schon dank der Mischung aus alter und neuer Bausubstanz, gutem britisch-bayerischen Design und meist angenehm authentischen Mitarbeitern sehr entspannend. Die Lage ist spektakulГ¤r, mit Blick Гјber Wiesen, WГ¤lder und Berge, weit und breit kein Zeichen der Zivilisation. Gute Badeeinrichtungen, sehr hochwertige und durchdachte SanitГ¤rrГ¤ume in den Zimmern (jedenfalls den ganz neuen), hilfreiche Hinweise und gepflegte (Leih-) Ausstattungen fГјr FreizeitaktivitГ¤ten.",4,ZeitgemГ¤Гџe 
"When entering Summerfields, the litchi and macadamia fields are impressive but do not promise much in terms of hospitality. The same applies to the unassuming tree tents that are the rooms. However, the qualities of the place then unfold one after another: The tents are better stocked and more functional and comfortable than most five star chain hotel rooms, the quality of the spa treatments is excellent, the food at dinner must be the best and most sophisticated within a wide radius, breakfast is just impressive, the setting is one of a kind, and relaxation is guaranteed. Highly recommended!",5,When

We were in the front room of this beautiful Queenslander, the house is filled with character and the walls are well stocked with the couple&acute;s art work which is for sale. Very interesting indeed.",5,We 
"We stayed in the Metropark in October 2009 for two weeks whilst holidaying in HK. It is a little further out from the central tourist hubs around the harbour, but I wouldn&acute;t call it a trek (unless you&acute;re really lazy) - it&acute;s only a ten minute stroll to the Tsim Sha Shui MTR station, there are buses which run regularly outside the hotel to the harbour, and the hotel has a free shuttle service - or, like us, you could walk the forty minutes it takes to get to the harbour and enjoy the sights en-route!",4,We 
We stayed five night here in July. We had a room with three queen beds. The rate was very good. It only has 24 rooms and they are all on one floor. Each room has an assigned parking place. It is right on the strip with plenty of sitting areas. Very nice indoor pool. Plenty of towels in the room. The cleaning staff is very nice and family oriented. Upon check in they give some very good coupons to surrounding shops. Even though it is right on the main road the rooms are very quite. We were never woken up to outside sounds. It is only a very short walking distance to many shops. It is operated by a family who cares about their motel. I am already talking about staying there next year.,1,We 
"We stayed at the Barcelo Costa for 2 weeks all inclusive and had a fab time. It was great value for money as there was a wide range of food and drinks available including cocktails! :) Our room was very big with a balcony overlooking the pool and sea and the shower was huge. The only problem we had was the heavy rain....it rained for 3 full days which then caused a leak in the roof. This was the only problem we had with the hotel as it took them two days to do anything, we then had to move rooms in the middle of the night as the leak got worse! Apart from this we had an amazing time, but would not go back in October due to it being the rainy season!",1,We 
We spent one night in this great hotel. The staff was great over the phone and in person. We needed an extra set of towels and unlike most hotels they actually brought them to the room. The carpet was so clean I would have slept on it. Great beds and great location. Very quiet rooms.,1,We 
"We picked this hotel because of its location and we were very happy. However upon arrival our room was so small we couldn&acute;t fit in with 2adults, 2 suitcases and 2 carry on bags. It was tiny and not a very nice view. Not a problem though, the staff moved us straight away to a beautiful top floor room with plenty of space. I feel sorry for anyone who gets stuck in the first room!!! The Mornington is close to tube station, Hyde Park, lovely shopping centre and little quirky pubs. Would recommend as the staff truly were very nice and the decor etc is lovely.",5,We

We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but when we arrived home several weeks later and reconciled our credit card payments with our accounts we found that this hotel had considerably overcharged us compared to the quote for accommodation that we had had in writing from them..,5,We 
We checked in a day earlier than planned. Some of our belongings went missing while they moved us from our first single room to our room that we had reserved. We had to go thru the garbage looking for the clothes and shoes and they could not be located. Even called the police to get a report and the front staff and Tim the manager just laughed. Accused us of stealing our own clothes. At the time of check out four days later the bell man found the clothes and they were easy to find in a maid&acute;s closet. The front staff laughed at my nephew when the boots were found because of the shape they were in. To my nephew who is 13 and his mother is dead those boots were his prize possession. Great motel but I would never stay there only because of Tim the manager.,2,We

This is a case of guests expectations - everyone&acute;s is different. Anyway, caught a taxi and found the hotel.",1,We 
We arrived approx 10pm where we were shown to our room. It was a very nice modern room with a sea view that was a bonus.,1,We 
"Was in town to celebrate a birthday party, so we stayed only 1 night. Staff was courteous from the front desk to the wait staff. Even showed us the hotel map & allowed us to pick which room we wanted to stay in. For those Marriott lovers, this is a pretty good Category 3 hotel. UNOs restaurant is next door & they deliver as well as a shopping mall which we didn&acute;t go to. The only thing that sucked was their full breakfast. Nothing to write home about. In any event, the rooms & bathrooms were nice & clean. Downside, no scenic views & the TV is not flat screen.",4,Was 
"Villa Cora somehow is not as well known as many other Florence hotels, but definitely at the top of the list. The building and everything around it is fully authentic and in excellent shape. Freshly refurbished with no signs of wear and tear, as in so many other Italian hotels. The service is outstanding and genuinely friendly and personal, and the restaurant is excellent. Villa Cora has a beautiful pool in a spectacular setting with sweeping views, yet is within walking distance to downtown. Highly recommended.",3,Villa 
"Very nice combination of old, carefully renovated premises and a modern, minimalist touch. Unique diversion from the local, somewhat stuffy style without feeling out of place.

"Took my wife there for her birthday last February as a surprise. Staff was incredibly friendly. Not much to do there during the winter season, however we went to both casinos (foxwoods & mohegan sun) & had a great time. Room was nice - pretty average (about 3 stars). Probably the best part about the place is it&acute;s location...plenty of restaurants and boutiques nearby. Would recommend.",2,Took 
"Thurnher&acute;s Alpenhof truly lives up to the standards they promise (and charge for). Every single detail is very well thought through and perfectly maintained. Food is excellent. Staff is extremely attentive and personal without being intrusive, treating first time visitors like old regulars with genuine friendlyness -- NOT the somewhat artificial hotel kind of friendlyness. Rooms can feel stuffy and old fashioned at first, but soon turn out to be very cozy just because of their timelessness. Somehow the place has managed to be very contemporary and modern in everything they do, without losing their traditional identity. Highly recommended.",5,Thurnher&acute;s

Lots of local cafes to choose from for breakfast if you don&acute;t have breakfast in the hotel (the hotel is a bit pricey at 15 euros each!) Also lots of nice bars and restaurants within walking distance.",4,This

Try to arrive in the daylight as it can be tricky to find, but once found you will be delighted. Enjoy the isolation and the feeling of being in the dessert while being close to the small township.",2,This

This is a lovely hotel in a great location - within walking distance of Oxford Street and only a 5 minute walk from the Baker Street tube station. There is a great little cafГ© next door to the hotel which I would definitely recommend for breakfast and wasn&acute;t very expensive either! (The French toast is amazing!),1,This 
"This is a great hotel outside of the island. The hotel was recently renovated and is clean and modern with very helpful staff. Even though it&acute;s about a 10-15 minute walk from the train station. It is very easy to find. Once you&acute;re at the hotel and want to get to the island, the bus stop going is right across the street and the bus stop is right infront of the hotel on the way back. The trip is about a 10 minute bus ride. All in all, a great hotel for the value and would definitely stay there again.",2,This

The location was excellent, close to everything, sights, restaurants, trains/bus. Very safe area, able to walk anywhere with no concerns. Don&acute;t have one complaint about this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",1,This 
"This hotel bills itself as a top five star boutique hotel, which it is certainly not. The facilities are a bit dated and worn. The place feels like a chain hotel converted into something that was supposed to be hip, but this plan did not really come to fruition. There are telltale signs of the old chain hotel past everywhere, mixed with some southern style elements, mixed with some Mondrian hotels style elements, all of which does not quite go together. The tastefulness of the decor is also highly debatable.",5,This 
"This hotel and village of Corsham is the best I&acute;ve ever been too. You will not be disappointed. We stayed 3 nites. The staff, room, food (both breakfast and dinner) were excellent. The rooms are so clean and well furbished. Very comfortable, we felt like we were at home. The staff from management to chef and bar/wait staff were all very friendly, helpful and an asset the hotel. Plenty of on site parking and close to Bath, Lacock and other sightseeing places. We will definitely stay here again. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.",1,This

"These cabins are in magnificent location part of the Jackson Lake Lodge. However, we found the cabins disappointing and inadequate. Ours consisted of a largish bedroom with two double beds and some furniture, a bathroom with shower over bath, a separate space with an extra hand basin, one storage cupboard and one wardrobe. Overall the appearance is shabby. Tiles in the bathroom area are badly chipped. There is NO refrigerator..... surely this is requirement in any kind of accommodation, hence much of our food went off. The fan in the bedroom was so noisy we couldn&acute;t have it on. The bed was comfortable and water was hot. Lighting was dim.",2,These 
"These apartments are set in the gorgeous little town of Bale in a building which is over 1,000 years old. The whole place has a wonderful vibe and the communal areas are decorated in a relaxed and artsy style which is cool without being pretentious. Jazz plays morning till night apparently with live performances regularly through the week.",4,These 
"There should be a special category for places like Illyria House here. It is more an experience than a hotel. Staying there is like being in an authentic re-enactment of colonial times. This means white-gloved butlers, lots of silverware and rugs and lace and wallpaper, and of course stunning premises. It also means a bit of dust and chipped paint and general maintenance issues, and food is not a focus. However, because of the unique experience and especially because of the extremely nice and welcoming staff, it is easy to forgive those shortcomings. Definitely far better than some random chain hotel. And with a bit of an investment this place could become truly stellar.",1,There 
"There is not much to add to the previous review. We spent one week at Riad Kniza over Christmas and New Year, and it was excellent. The Riad feels like a secluded, tranquil island of luxury in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The staff is genuinely friendly, hospitable and helpful while being very discreet. The ""restaurant"" does not feel like one but more like being hosted in someone&acute;s private home, and the food is by far the best we have tasted in Marrakech (and we have been to a few other acclaimed restaurants while there). The interior feels authentic, not overdesigned in a faux western style like many other places, and is perfectly maintained as if it was opened only recently. Very nice and quiet roof terrace, where breakfast is served upon request. We hope we will have a chance to return soon.",4,There 
"The villa suites are very spacious as well as functional. Decor is done in reference to the Provence, and a good match with the Franschhoek region. Overall a very nice experience, despite the somewhat impersonal service, which might be due to the scattered layout of the premises. The receptionist gave false information about the opening times of restaurants in town and steered us towards the hotel&acute;s own restaurant.",5,The 
"The View ALMOST matches the real view from the balcony of all rooms which is breathtakingly stunning. If you are going to Monument valley then this is the place to stay. A very smart hotel, although somewhat difficult to find the entrance which is a very small doorway into this amazing venue, nestled into the rocks in the dessert, painted the same colour as the background scenery it is very unobtrusive.",4,The 
"The Tides is an excellent hotel in every respect. Stylish design, perfect maintenance, efficiency and attention to detail down to the smallest aspects, extremely friendly and truly welcoming staff. Highly recommended. The only two caveats are the food at the restaurant (which does not fully live up in quality to the high ambitions of the place) and the beds (which have much too soft mattresses for my taste).",1,The

Dimensions are gargantuan, and the facilities match the environment. A true large-scale country experience. Rooms are equally big, and fittingly decorated. Very nice and friendly staff. The only minor drawback was that the restaurant could improve a bit, in terms of both food quality and waitstaff training. Overall, a highly memorable and recommended experience.",2,The 
"The Sands is a very intimate property with only five rooms and very nice and caring staff. Private terraces/lawns, infinity pool, direct beach access. Everything blending in nicely with the very specific local Dutch/African thatched roof architecture style. Nice miniature restaurant that feels like a treehouse above the beach.",3,The 
The rooms could have been cleaner but I was not afraid to go barefoot. Towels were small but good quality. Good water pressure. Housekeeper very nice and helpful. Parking is a downside. Great views. Very small tv but who goes to the beach to watch tv. Beds hard but very clean and comfortable. Elevators not as slow as people say. I called the office about 6 times before checking in and very pleased with the way treated. After I booked the room online the rates went down and John was very willing to give me the new rates. Sent me an email confirming as promised. As I was checking in some people had their dates messed up and they were very helpful to change them. I have not noticed any odors.,4,The

Located in Chinatown right next to the Outram Park subway station (which also offers easy access to the airport), it is in a good spot with lots of atmosphere and food options away from the somewhat ""heartless"" business district.",3,The 
"The Mondrian Soho has just opened and still feels very new. Cool design throughout the hotel, bright and airy white/blue/marbe color scheme in the rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows. Despite its young age, the hotel has already managed to attract a good crowd to its restaurant/bar/lounge on the ground floor nightly, creating a vibe that is pretty cool and not as drab as most hotel bars.",5,The 
"The Matahari is one of the most relaxing hotels I have ever been to. The remoteness (3,5 hours by car across the mountains from the airport) only adds to this experience, and so does the lack of any major must-see sights in the area. It allows for pure relaxation in a stylish, but not over-styled and very authentic environment. All you could ever ask for is there, including an excellent diving center with equally excellent dive sites. My only minor concern is with the food, which is neither truly and authentically Indonesian nor overly good in the European sense, and also steeply priced. But I guess it is hard to please the palates of a wide variety of guests.",2,The 
"The Lofts are on Thesen Island, which is a relatively new development of vacation homes and not a ""organically grown"" area and therefore has a certain athmosphere that one should be aware of. The guest house itself feels like a guest house, which it is, and NOT like a hotel. The staff is helpful but services are somewhat limited. Pool is the size of a large bath tub and not very well maintained. So are the rooms (we stayed in one of the regular rooms): On the smaller side, a little worn/rusty/moldy, permanently stained towels, the bathroom had an automatic fragrance sprayer of the kind used in public bathrooms that emitted the smell of an airport urinal every fifteen minutes. The decor was not done with a lot of attention to detail and to me did not feel very individual or tasteful, but as if someone went to IKEA and carted back a truckload of stuff. Still, it definitely is a good base to explore Knysna and its surroundings. Overall a decent but not perfect place.",3,The 
"The Limelight Lodge is in excellent skiing base, in the very center of Aspen. Clean and comfortable rooms, good facilities and layout, cozy lounge with fireplace and panoramic view. Genuinely welcoming atmosphere. Only minor drawbacks are a few very clueless staff members (though most are nice and competent) and the painfully slow wireless internet service (which does not allow for any real work to get done).",1,The 
"The Legian is a hotel that has a true, natural style and class rarely found today with so many new places trying to be ""hip"". The design is contemporary and balinese without being overstyled or tacky. The staff is 100% professionally trained, genuinely friendly, unintrusive, and never give the impression of being after a tip. The food is excellent, both local and western, very diverse and among the best ever had in many hotels in Bali. The only negative thing that can be said is that some details in the rooms are slightly worn and in need of updating -- the hotel is starting to show its age. But this still somehow adds to the character.",4,The

Wonderful blinds which keeps every room quiet and dark. No charge for parking. Suites are available and they are second to none with fridge, HD TV, plenty of work area and more. And oh, the hotel is family run and they take painstaking efforts to make sure your stay is outstanding. IвЂ™ve stayed here three times and am looking forward to returning next week.",1,The

It offers almost all of the services and standards of an upscale hotel (except for restaurants, which are plentiful in the immediate vicinity), but the rooms are actually apartments and therefore much more spacious, including full-sized kitchens. It is located just a short walk away from the center of town, and a free shuttle bus operates on demand, including pick-ups from anywhere in town. Friendly and very efficient staff.",2,The

The design of the villas is contemporary, fresh, and clean without the usual folkloristic touches. Staff is extremely nice and does everything to make the stay perfect.",5,The

Rooms are very stylish, tasteful, and with high quality furnishings. Generous closet space, very well thought out and practical. Very good - though almost always quite empty - restaurant. Nice staff that leaves nothing to wish for.",1,The 
"The Chamberlain truly feels like a home away from home, with lots of local charm conveyed by the interior decoration that probably can only be found in L.A. (lots of bold patterns, stark contrasts, pastel colors). It is located on a quiet residential street just between Sunset Blvd and Santa Monica Blvd (both within immediate walking distance), which in addition to the residential style outer appearance, entrance area, and hidden garage makes one feel as if really living there, instead of just being a guest at a random place catering to the traveling salesmen set on some throughfare. Nice little rooftop pool and equally nice restaurant with charming courtyard. Very helpful and reliable staff.",2,The 
"The Bowery Hotel is very nicely furnished in a faux antique old English kind of style. Since the building is a brand new construction and the furnishings are aging well, things are functioning and are not overly worn, noisy, or otherwise difficult to deal with, such as so many other New York hotels. The rooms have a decent size and nice powerful showers. Downstairs the scene is happening and chilled at once, with some celebrity spotting. My only suggestion would be to spend more time training the staff, especially the receptionists. They seem somewhat unprofessional and uninterested.",4,The 
"The Alexander is a very welcoming place, with genuinely nice and caring - as well as entertaining - staff. Suites are homey and perfectly equipped. The best part is of course the location, high on the cliff, which is just spectacular. Decor is exuberant and maybe not everyone&acute;s taste, but this does not take away from the quality of the hosts and location.",5,The 
"Teremok Marine is very stylishly and tastefully decorated, and has a truly homey atmosphere. The Durban View suite feels not like a hotel room but like a private home, and the common honesty bar area and kitchen contribute to this. Reception is a cozy sitting room instead of the usual counter, and the spa/gym/pool area spell vacation. Staff was friendly and welcoming.",1,Teremok 
"Staying here feels a little bit like being in a time warp in some ways. In a way it&acute;s a beautfully vintage hotel, but in another it&acute;s just that bit too tired and worn to pull it off. The rooms are lovely and big, with electric candle chandelliers. The bathrooms were again very nice and vintage looking. The furniture in general is a little worn, the beds a bit uncomfortable. The staff are extremely helpful and the location is good for Bayswater, where you can find lots of yummy Oriental food.",3,Staying

"Rooms are nice and feel uncluttered due to their minimalism, which works well with the maritime surroundings. Hoewever, there is minimal to no view of the ocean, and most rooms face a noisy and smelly airconditioning and garbage storage courtyard. Service is minimal and has the attitude of overworked hostel clerks. All in all the pretty steep room rate over the 4th of July weekend was not proportional to what the hotel delivered. On top of this all extras come with hefty price tags (two shaky bicycles for one day USD 50, beach chairs and umbrella 25 USD).",3,Rooms

When I got there with my wife, the hotel room was NOTHING like what was shown on the website. The hotel claims rooms were renovated recently, they sure fooled me. The bed was HORRIBLE. The center of the matress was sagging as there was no box spring and it felt like we were sleeping on sofa bed. The walls looked dirty and the light fixtures were tacky.",5,Rome 
"Restaurant food at dinner is excellent. However, the breakfast buffet is below the level of a youth hostel and certainly inadequate of Relais & Chateaux with its three sad and sorry slices of random cold cuts and some cereals. Service is equally inadequate. No staff could be found in the breakfast room for half an hour straight, orders were only taken after complaining to reception. Coffee was then served in boiling hot metal jugs with no mitts. Also at all other times staff seems to be avoiding any guest contact, being indifferent at best. Was told to call some therapist&acute;s number in town upon trying to book a massage advertised in the room, receptionist did not feel inclined to handle this task. Ordering a snack other than cheese at 14h30 turned out to impossible because ""the chef has left"". And the list of non-service experiences goes on. Very disappointing.",3,Restaurant

The few rooms are decorated with the owner&acute;s personal collection of 1800&acute; antiques such as four poster beds, writing desks, wardrobe trunks, and hat boxes. Staff is very thoughtful and could not be more different from random chain hotel employees. Dinner in the tiny non-public, residents-only restaurant is excellent and served on carefully selected china with antique silverware and tasteful table setup. Only potential drawback for some people is the communal table policy. Overall a one-of-a-kind place of the highest quality that is truly memorable and offers unbeatable value for money.",5,Palmiet

Clean and comfortable but small and very old fashioned. Even though there is a NON Smoking policy somone on our top floor was smoking and stunk our room out. Not sure how they monitor this policy!!. We mentioned it next day and got an apology but I think we shoulld have had a discount on our overpriced room for the uncomforable night we experienced.. Also parking is a bit of a walk up a hill, exhausting with 2 large suitcases. We had a lovely breakfast the next morning, however overall I would not stay here again.",4,My 
"My husband and I stayed here on route to Bath. We had trouble finding accommodation and when we arrived at Holiday Inn they had one room left which we took. The manager of reception was so nice and friendly, a very personable young man. The hotel was very clean, new, spacious and quiet. Located a good 7min drive from centre of town but close to the main motorways. A lovely place which I would recommend. One more plug for the reception manager who was extremely nice.",2,My 
My husband and I stayed at the Travelodge LAX en route home to Australia. While the staff were pleasant enough the hotel room itself was an absolute dump. Dirty smelly and I would never recommend staying there.,1,My 
My husband and I spent the weekend in this beautiful relaxing tranquil retreat. Spotlessly clean and excellently presented chalet. We would thoroughly recommend it and will return. The hosts Bryan and Anne are extremely friendly and helpful. You won&acute;t be disappointed.,1,My 
"Motel is not worth the price by any means. One of our beds had a soiled top sheet that had obviously not been changed. Very non caring staff that brought sheets at 11:15pm. Would not find us a comforter. When checking out very rude lady with long brown hair again uncaring about our concern. She In fact called for someone to come get breakfast bar because people ""were still snatching."" It was 9:58 and it was stuff that was going to be thrown away. She was rude to another man who was asking about the closing of breakfast. A nice lady and gentleman was working the evening shift and answered all questions.",5,Motel 
Me and my folks were in town for a wedding and stayed over for the Thanksgiving day holiday weekend.,1,Me 
"Lobster House is very well designed architecturally, with beautiful views of both Camps Bay below and Table Mountain above. On the service/hospitality side of things, the team is a bit rough and gives the whole place the feel of a hostel, with transient guests that basically are expected to help themselves.",2,Lobster

"Imbali Safari Lodge probably is not a five star property, and service and food quality are nothing to write home about. It is however a thoroughly solid experience, and completely fine considering the (remote) location and the (reasonable) price.",1,Imbali 
"Im Vergleich zu unserem Aufenthalt vor einigen Jahren hГ¤lt die Bleiche nicht mehr, was sie verspricht. Damals war der Aufenthalt in jeder Hinsicht perfekt, heute ist er das Geld nicht mehr wert. Das Personal wirkt lustlos und desinteressiert, manchmal sogar schnippisch. Das Essen in den Hauptrestaurants ist bestenfalls mittelmГ¤Гџig, jedenfalls im VerhГ¤ltnis zum aufgerufenen Preis. KrГ¶nung dieses qualitativen Niedergangs war, dass kleingeschnittene Reste der Hauptspeise vom Vortag am nГ¤chsten Tag auf dem VorspeisenbГјffet recycled wurden. Bei aller beabsichtigten antiken Anmutung wirken die Zimmer - und teilweise auch der Spabereich - inzwischen eindeutig abgewohnt, zerfleddert und lieblos. Direkt neben einer der Ruhezonen des Spabereichs wurde eine Sonnenbank mit MГјnzeinwurf, einem BelГјftungssystem wie ein Strahltriebwerk und lautstarker Computerstimme aufgestellt. Auch sauber ist es nicht Гјberall, die Toilette im Badezimmer mit DDR-Anmutung mГјffelte anhaltend nach abgestandenem Urin, und der Zimmerservice lieГџ drei Tage lang (!) benutztes Geschirr auf dem Gang vor dem Zimmer stehen.",5,Im 
I&acute;ve stayed here a few times over the last few years - so having read recent reviews I was unsure as to whether to stay again.,1,I&acute;ve 
"I&acute;ve been a fan of Marriott for about 10 years now & this place did not disapoint. This place is in the heart of Downtown Stamford. Tons of places to eat & the mall was about 2-3 blocks away. As stated in the earlier reviews they have a Cayenne Porsche that will shuttle you anywhere you want to go in the downtown area. One downside - If you go, request a room that&acute;s not close to the elevator. At night we heard every conversation that took place in front of our room. Other than that, it was a nice stay. Note: if you plan to visit within the next month; ask the front desk or google for an i-shop stamford card for meal & shopping discounts in the area. Average discount is about 10% & there&acute;s a restaurant called kona grill that gives u a buy one - get one free meal.",2,I&acute;ve 
"I was a group leader and we had 10 rooms to begin with and eventually reduced the number due to cleanliness, security concerns and noise.",4,I 
"I travel quite a bit but have rarely encountered such genuine hospitality. The innkeepers are truly passionate. Not in the usual ""trained"" sense, but for real, while being very unobtrusive. Highly recommended experience.",4,I 
"I travel quite a bit and still have to say that this is one of the best hotels I ever stayed at. The staff is extremely friendly, warm, and welcoming without being overbearing or intrusive -- genuinely and without any of that fake hotel school kindness. Every single one of the few rooms in the house is done in a different style and with greatest attention to detail. Even the last door knob or light switch is carefully individually selected. High quality artwork everywhere. Very tasteful and not a trace of trackiness or stuffiness. The courtyard is very athmospheric with great food and a great scene. Highly recommended for a stay in downtown Cape Town.",5,I 
"I travel extensively, 150+ nights on the road. I am a Intercontinental Hotel Group Platinum and Ambassador member. This was the poorest hotel experience and use of hotel points (80,000) in years.",5,I 
"I stayed in the Ayrlington for 3 nights with my mother in mid-July. The hotel is only about ten minutes walk from the centre of town. We stayed in the Carnation room, which is the smallest room in the hotel and the only twin, but is very well laid out to make most of the space. The room and ensuite bathroom was very clean, although like all rooms in the building it was very hot. However, once we had opened the windows - with some assistance from the helpful man on reception! - the room cooled down quickly.",2,I 
"I stayed at the Thistle City Barbican for two nights in December 2012. Three of us shared a very cramped room, there wasn&acute;t much storage space, only the one wardrobe and definitely not enough power sockets for 3 girls! (only two sockets in the room) The wardrobe doors were broken but this wasn&acute;t a major problem. Saying that, we were part of a group and other friends were in a much bigger 3 bed room so if there are 3 of you it may be worth requesting the bigger room!",1,I 
"I spent 6 nights here on business. I travel 100+ nights a year. Having staff that are willing and try to help is of high importance, regardless of the language/location.",3,I 
I loved the location of this hotel plus it was great value for money!,3,I 
"I have stayed in at least twenty upscale hotels in NYC over the last few years and this is probably the best of them. Tasteful decor, perfectly maintained, unusually spacious feel for NYC and without the gap between nice lobby and not so nice rooms found in most NYC hotels. Very nice function rooms, good coffee shop for a quick and perfect coffee/muffin in the morning, complete with movie scene views. Complemented by the free minibar and snacks, which may not have much of a monetary value, but are a nice touch adding to the homey feel. Staff is personable and truly helpful. Really nothing to complain about.",4,I 
"I have stayed at this hotel 4 times now. The location, amenities and parking are very good. Parking is free.",1,I 
"I have stayed at 60 Thompson every now and then since it opened twelve years ago. Back then it was happening and welcoming, today it is pretty dreary. All that is left is the still tasteful interior design, though now many of the furnishings are in shambles and in dire need of work. Textiles are worn and stained, handles are falling off of the furniture, the sink almost falls of off the wall upon touching it, faucets hang loose, the shower head has been replaced by a $4.99 variety in white plastic, and pretty much everything is chipped and seems to be falling apart. The staff matches this situation: No help with luggage upon arrival or cab hailing services, bored receptionist, people seem to have given up. Sad to see such a formerly great place going downhill.",3,I 
I have just come back from staying at the Treehouse at Harptree court for two nights and it was amazing!,4,I 
I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel 5 times in the past 7 years. Total days are more than 20. Recommend the executive level. Cost is a bit more but you can make up for it with the evening and breakfast services. It is hard to leave the hotel not recognizing someone for their excellent service.,3,I 
"I ended up running out of options when making a business trip and having to pay ВЈ120 for the privilage of staying here for one night; London Fashion Week meant everything was booked up. On initial glances it looked a bit rough around the edges but OK. On peeling back the duvet I found some suspicious looking hairs in the bed. It was late, and it struck me as the kind of hotel that would have this standard throughout the rooms anyway so I did the sensible thing - went out with a friend and had some drinks! Even with earplugs in the old sash windows meant that it was very noisy, and my curtains didn&acute;t cover the window fully so I woke with the light. What really upset me about my stay here was that there was no hot water in the morning. I ended up having a cold shower, as I was facing clients that day, it was miserable!",2,I 
"I book a lot of hotels for business purposes and, this being a chain hotel in the center of London, was expecting rude, unhelpful staff, tiny rooms, and the general impression of a hotel which due to cost and location is always fully booked, and therefore doesn&acute;t care about providing good customer service. I&acute;m glad to say I was wrong! All of the staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful throughout our two night stay. They had no problem handling our booking and checking-in, despite the fact that we were partly paying using Tesco vouchers. The restaurant staff and concierge were likewise very helpful and friendly. I even noticed the restaurant staff and chef responding to some very specific dietary requests from other guests without it being a problem.",4,I 
"I arrived at this hotel after a late flight, &acute;Phoned them for a pick-up and with great difficulty in understanding what the person was saying - due to a very heavy accent, I was picked up by a friendly driver. After a lot of dithering at the desk and a request to copy my drivers license, (which I would not allow) as they had already seen two items of ID, I was shown to my room. I requested that I be called early at 4.00AM to catch the 4.30AM shuttle to the airport",1,I

"Hotel hat hohe Ambitionen, vor allem im kulinarischen Bereich und im Service, bietet aber allenfalls mittelmГ¤Гџige Leistungen. Die Buffets und MenГјs bestehen aus mit groГџen Worten umschriebenen Produkten einfachster QualitГ¤t, zu groГџen Teilen offenbar aus Eimern aus dem GroГџhandel. Service changiert zwischen indifferent und zickig. Simpelste Leistungen wie beispielsweise Weckrufe gehГ¶ren nicht zum Standard, stattdessen muss der Gast am Zimmertelefon mithГ¶ren, wie Rezeptionistin mit Kollegin Гјber dessen ""unverschГ¤mte"" Anfrage spricht. Gast wird wegen nur in bar zu entrichtendem 2-в‚¬-Pfand fГјr Skipass auf Zimmer zurГјckgeschickt, was Jugendherbergsstandard entspricht, nicht vier Sternen. Ebenso die Menge fremder Haare im Bett.",5,Hotel 
"Hotel delivers top-notch, very traditional German-style service and food. Staff is thoroughly trained and does not miss a beat -- which can border on the somewhat mechanic, though. Rooms are equally well apointed but somewhat dated, at least in the ""Landhaus"" annex. Guests tend to be on the older side, and the overall atmosphere at times resembles that of a cruise ship. Location could not be better and more beautiful. Choices inside and outside of the hotel abound. Excellent venue for upscale traditional vacation experience.",3,Hotel 
"Hotel Americano has very tasteful, consistent contemporary design, a good vibe, and a good crowd. On the functional side, it has its drawbacks, though - just like most NYC hotels in this category. Rooms are tiny with barely any space to put things, bathrooms are lacking shelving and towel hangers near the shower, and walls are paper thin, barely filtering noise out. Noise is also a problem due to construction and several clubs across the street, plus we even had an unexplained fire alarm in the middle of the night. Whether to stay there or not simply depends on personal preferences: Style vs. practicalities.",1,Hotel 
"Hidden Gem right near the South Street Seaport. - Quickly becoming a fan of the Hampton inn Franchise. Three things makes this place stand out in no particular order. 1. Location 2. Price 3. Staff. This place is literally around the corner from all the Seaport activities and fine dining. Online, they had a ridiculous rate of $200 (weekend rate) - this really made the stay worth it as most other places charge $300 a night and above - Staff was exceptional. Really went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. Room was nice, but just remember, it&acute;s not designed for the average traveler to hang out in the room. Our room was pretty small, but nice and comfortable enough to sleep. Breakfast was also included, but nothing to brag about. - Continental style",1,Hidden

Had a night at this hotel. It is newer and I like the updated style. There was a large number of children and families but the rooms were very well designed so the noise was nominal.

Great Hotel - rooms are decent and furnished well and quiet - executive lounge with its afternoon tea and evening drinks not to be missed if you&acute;ve booked an exec room or are a Hilton Honiors Gold or higher member - as is the complementary breakfast - not as extensive as breakfast buffet in main restaurant but still good.,2,Great 
"First-rate architectural design and very relaxing secluded atmosphere. Staff is friendly but somehow there does not seem to be a true okami holding the place together. Food was sometimes good and sometimes not so good, including abalone and meat so though it was not edible. Very overpriced for what was offered. The town&acute;s attractions can be seen in less than one hour, so staying for more than one night is probably not a good idea.",3,First-rate 
First the positives:,4,First 
"Excellent traditional country hotel with good food and a traditional style matching the surroundings. Friendly, welcoming service. Some shortcomings in maintenance, such as broken fixtures and grimey pool loungers in dire need of a good scrub. Restaurant service tries hard but is not on the same level as the very good food, which is probably the only reason separating the place from a Michelin star. Overall very pleasant experience.",5,Excellent

Food is very good with a well balanced mix of local and international dishes, and four or five specials are offered every day in addition to the usual menu. Older rooms can feel somewhat dark, but newer rooms (upstairs) are bright and airy and very clean. Overall, Blue Moon is a simple but very nice and friendly place to stay -- away from mass tourism and with easy access to the famous scuba diving sites of East Bali.",3,Blue

"Arrived here to find the room freezing cold, with no way of improving the temperature. The hand soap dispenser on the wall was nearly empty and there was just a hole in the wall of the bathroom where the shower gel dispenser should have been. I was travelling alone, and as a young woman am very keen to feel safe and secure in my hotel room. However this area is pretty ""vibrant"" and a homeless guy followed me down the street and tried to come into the hotel with me. Seeing as the reception was unstaffed at the time I didn&acute;t have anyone to help me get rid of him which made me feel really insecure. I was woken up at 4am when people started shouting and slamming doors. Generally this is a hotel for chavs. I stayed at the Kings Cross one the next night, 2 minutes walk away and a lot better value for the money.",3,Arrived 
Although not central London this is a great alternative - at a good price the hotel is only 5 minutes or so walk to Sutton Station with a frequent 30 minute rail service to Victoria ВЈ8.70 day return or 15 pound for all day zone 1- 5 travel card which cover peak travel .

So is the genuinely friendly and personal - yet highly professional - welcome and service by Helen and her well trained team.

The decor of the rooms and common areas is a bit dated and caters to an older crowd, but does add to the homey atmosphere.",3,Altes

Also, the location may be somewhat out of the way for some (but always worked for me).",4,After

Our room was simply but adequately furnished and kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay - for example, towels were refreshed at least twice during the week.
